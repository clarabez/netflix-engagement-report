### Data project to play with some movie titles

The idea behind this project is to read the Netflix Engagement Report, the open report released twice a year containing data about the most viewed movies in the platform - [link here](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report).

I also want to play with some new python libs like streamlit, for example. So that is a good opportunity to play with data and visualize the information in a dashboard.

**What I am using here:** </br>
Netflix Data: [Netflix Engagement Report](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-a-netflix-engagement-report)</br> 
Public Movies API: [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)</br> 

**Stack:** </br>
Language: Python </br>
Dashboard: [StreamLink](https://docs.streamlit.io/) </br>
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)</br>
